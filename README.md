# Prime Number Detection

This project contains VHDL implementation of Prime Number Detection of 8 bit unsigned numbers. Two different approaches were tried:
1. Trial Division
1. Miller Rabin Test

## Components
1. PND_Trial_Division
2. MRT

## Future Improvements
* Decreasing the latency of the final result for MRT
* Replace the for loops inside PND Trial Division with a clock based implementation
* Developing MRT which supports larger bit width for inputs

## Contributing 
Fell free to submit a pull request :)
